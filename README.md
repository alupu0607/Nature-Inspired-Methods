## **1️⃣ Numerical Optimization with GA & HC**
### Description
Implemented and hybridized Genetic Algorithms with Hill Climbing for numerical function optimization. The test functions used include:
- **Rastrigin's function**
- **Griewangk's function**
- **Rosenbrock's function**
- **Michalewicz's function**

The optimization was performed on:
- **2, 30, and 100 dimensions**
- **Precision of at least 5 decimal places**

### Implementation Details
- Language: **C++**
- Utilized **thread pool** for parallel optimization.
- Hybridized GA with **Hill Climbing** for improved performance.


## **2️⃣ MinMax-MTSP with GA & ACO**
### Description
Implemented and compared Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for solving the **MinMax Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MinMax-MTSP)**.  
Both approaches yielded **very good** and comparable results.

### Implementation Details
- Language: **C++**
- Used **thread pool** for efficiency.
- **GA and ACO were tested in parallel** to compare their effectiveness.

## **Results**
- Achieved very good results across all optimization tasks.
- Detailed **results and analysis are available in the PDFs** included in this repository.
